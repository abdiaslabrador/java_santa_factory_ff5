# Project - Santa Claus Toy Factory
OH! OH! OH! Santa needs your help developer! For this Christmas Santa has decided to revamp his toy management system and stop manually creating long scrolls. But BEWARE! The system will behave differently depending on whether it is used by Santa or one of his elves and the data storage system will be different depending on whether the toy is for good children or if it is a toy for naughty children.

You have been tasked with creating a console application that will allow Santa's elves to record the toys created, list the inventory and delete toys.

If the application is used by Santa then he will be able to get the list of toys for good children or the list of toys for naughty children. You should also be able to save the complete list of all toys in .csv format.
